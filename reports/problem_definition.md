# Research-to-Market AI Marketplace - Problem Definition

## Vision Statement
"An AI-powered marketplace that transforms academic and scientific research into market-ready innovation by connecting researchers, investors, and industry partners through explainable trust and semantic intelligence."

## Problem Statement
The research-to-commercialization pathway is fundamentally broken, creating inefficiencies for all stakeholders:

**For Industry Partners:** Waste significant time manually searching, retrieving, reading, and analyzing multiple research papers (PDFs with complex content like images, tables, mathematical proofs) to determine if they represent viable commercial opportunities. The process of consolidating 3-5 papers and validating use cases against Problem-Solution Fit and Commercial Feasibility criteria is slow and repetitive.

**For Investors:** Lack efficient mechanisms to discover non-obvious research with commercial potential, missing high-value opportunities hidden in academic publications. Current deal flow relies on personal networks rather than systematic intelligence.

**For Researchers:** Struggle to connect their innovations with the right industry partners and investors who can bring their research to market. Technology transfer offices provide limited support, and researchers lack visibility into commercial applications of their work.

**Market Context:**
- **70%+ of high-impact academic research never reaches commercialization** - brilliant innovations remain trapped in academia
- **Investors and corporates struggle to identify non-obvious research with commercial potential** - lacking efficient discovery and evaluation mechanisms
- **IP offices rely on outdated manual scouting and fragmented patent intelligence** - missing opportunities for technology transfer and commercialization
- **Researchers lack clear pathways** from publication to productization, with limited visibility into market needs and investor interest

## Marketplace Stakeholder Workflows

The Research-to-Market AI Marketplace will support three core stakeholder workflows:
1. **Industry Partner Workflow** - Discover and evaluate research for commercialization (Phase 1 focus)
2. **Investor Workflow** - Discover validated opportunities and connect with industry partners (Future phase)
3. **Researcher Workflow** - Submit research and connect with commercial partners (Future phase)

---

## Current Workflow: Industry Partner (Phase 1 Focus)

This workflow is the initial focus for MVP development. Once validated, the marketplace will expand to support investor and researcher workflows.

**Who:** Industry partners (R&D teams, innovation hubs, enterprise product leaders) searching for technology research (AI/ML focus initially) to commercialize

**Frequency:** Each time an industry partner wants to explore a new problem area or innovation opportunity

**Trigger:** Industry partner has one of three entry points:
1. Browse available research on the platform
2. Come with a specific problem/need to solve
3. Upload a research paper they already have

**Current Steps:**

1. **Search Phase**: Industry partner searches arXiv/Google Scholar for technology papers based on topic/problem area
2. **Retrieval Phase**: System retrieves multiple research papers from external sources
3. **Ranking Phase**: System ranks papers by relevance to search criteria
4. **Selection Phase**: Industry partner reviews ranked results and selects top 3-5 papers
5. **Reading & Comprehension Phase**: Industry partner with the help of AI reads through PDFs containing text, images, tables, mathematical proofs
6. **Consolidation Phase**: Industry partner / AI analyzes selected papers to determine likelihood of solving customer pain point/problem
7. **Validation Phase**: Industry partner / AI evaluates against key criteria:
   - **Problem-Solution Fit**: Does the research address a real-world problem? Who are the potential users or buyers? What are the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)?
   - **Commercial Feasibility**: Can this research be developed into a viable product without major technical or regulatory hurdles? Are development costs reasonable? Can it scale effectively?
   - **Intellectual Property (Patents & Copyrights):**: The industry partner and/or AI conduct a patent search and assess copyright protection for the research outputs.
8. **Documentation Submission**: 
   - **No Patents**: If there no patents or copyrights protection are discovered, the Industry partner with the help of AI creates and submits use case validation document ready for investor review.
    - **Patents**: If patents, the industry partner approaches the Researcher to establish partnership in phase 2 of this project.

**Friction Points:**
- **Retrieving multiple research papers** from external sources (arXiv, Google Scholar)
- **Reading and comprehending complex PDF content** (images, tabular data, mathematical proofs)
- **Consolidating insights** across 3-5 papers to determine commercial viability
- **System performance slowdown** when processing and analyzing multiple complex PDFs
- **Time-intensive manual analysis** to evaluate Problem-Solution Fit and Commercial Feasibility
- **Documentation creation** requires significant effort to structure findings
- **Discovery gap:** Investors and corporates lack efficient mechanisms to identify non-obvious research with commercial potential beyond obvious keyword searches
- **Fragmented intelligence:** IP offices and tech transfer offices rely on outdated manual scouting processes and fragmented patent intelligence systems
- **Market failure:** 70%+ of high-impact academic research never reaches commercialization due to poor research-to-market pathways

## Desired Outcome

**Marketplace Vision (Long-term):**
- **Researchers** can submit their innovations and get matched with industry partners and investors interested in commercializing their work
- **Industry Partners** can efficiently discover, evaluate, and validate research opportunities, creating investor-ready use case documents
- **Investors** can discover validated commercial opportunities with complete due diligence and connect directly with industry partners ready to build
- **Ecosystem** reduces the 70% commercialization failure rate by creating transparent, efficient pathways from research to market

**Phase 1 Success (Industry Partner Workflow):**
- Industry partner has a validated use case document showing the research can become a viable product
- The document is investor-ready with complete analysis of Problem-Solution Fit and Commercial Feasibility
- Both outputs achieved efficiently through AI-assisted analysis
- Industry partner can signal interest to connect with investors through the marketplace

**Key Metrics (Phase 1):**
- **Quality**: Use case validation covers all key criteria (Problem-Solution Fit, Commercial Feasibility)
- **Accuracy**: The consolidated analysis correctly represents the research papers
- **Completeness**: All required documentation fields are filled
- **Efficiency**: Time to validated use case document reduced by 60-80% vs manual process
- **Marketplace Readiness**: Document formatted for investor discovery and matching

---

## Constraints

**Human Control Requirements:**
- Human must review the final use case before submission
- Compliance/privacy requirements exist for handling research papers and company strategy

**Autonomous Capabilities Allowed:**
- AI can autonomously search and retrieve papers from arXiv/Google Scholar
- AI can autonomously rank papers by relevance to search criteria
- AI can autonomously draft the commercial feasibility analysis
- AI must respect compliance/privacy requirements throughout

**Resource Limitations:**
- System performance is impacted by processing multiple complex PDFs
- Must handle multimodal content (text, images, tables, mathematical notation)
- Integration needed with external research platforms (arXiv, Google Scholar)

---

## Assumptions Analysis

### Initial Assumptions Identified:
1. Industry partners need to manually select which 3-5 papers to analyze from ranked results
2. The system must retrieve and process all papers before any analysis can begin
3. Consolidating insights across multiple papers requires human reading and interpretation
4. Commercial feasibility analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM, costs, scalability) requires human business judgment
5. Industry partners need to see the full PDF content to trust the analysis
6. The use case document format must be created/written by humans
7. System performance will be slow when processing multiple complex PDFs
8. All three entry points (browse, problem-search, upload) require the same workflow steps

### Validated Constraints (Must remain true):
- **Deep PDF analysis is necessary** - Cannot rely on key sections only; critical insights may be scattered throughout papers
- **Human validation required** - Human must review and validate final use case before submission
- **Compliance/privacy requirements** - Must respect handling requirements for research papers and company strategy
- **Accuracy is critical** - System must correctly represent research paper content in analysis

### Flexible Assumptions (Opportunities for autonomy):
- **Paper selection transparency**: AI can rank 10-15 papers with scores and explanations; human selects final 3-5 with ability to question exclusions ("Why wasn't paper X included?"). Use Chain-of-Thought and LLM-as-judge for validation.
- **Progressive hybrid processing**: Retrieve and analyze papers in parallel (not sequential batch), consolidate insights once top 3-5 are analyzed, then enable interactive refinement based on human feedback
- **Autonomous commercial feasibility drafting**: AI can draft all components (TAM/SAM/SOM estimation via market research, development cost assessment from similar launches, regulatory hurdle identification, scalability analysis) - human validates and refines rather than creates from scratch
- **AI-generated documentation**: AI can draft the entire use case validation document structure and content
- **Adaptive entry point workflows**: Different entry points should trigger different AI behaviors:
  - **Browse**: Show trending/curated research with less aggressive filtering
  - **Problem-search**: Aggressively filter and rank by problem-solution fit
  - **Upload**: Analyze provided paper + optionally suggest related research to strengthen case

### Beliefs to Test (Need experimental validation):
- Will industry partners trust AI-ranked papers if scoring logic is transparent and explainable?
- Can Chain-of-Thought + LLM-as-judge provide sufficient validation confidence for AI selections?
- Will progressive/streaming results improve perceived performance enough to justify architectural complexity?
- What's the optimal balance of analysis depth vs. speed for commercial viability assessment?
- How much explanation/citation is needed for AI-drafted commercial feasibility analysis to be trusted by industry partners and investors?
- Does the human need to remain the first problem identifier, or can the AI proactively suggest problems based on the research it surfaces?

## Solution Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: AI Research Assistant (Conservative)
**Autonomy Level:** AI as Assistant (Level 1)

**What AI Does Autonomously:**
- Searches arXiv/Google Scholar based on user's topic/problem query
- Retrieves and processes PDFs (full deep analysis)
- Ranks 10-15 papers with relevance scores and explanations
- Extracts key information from each paper (problem addressed, methodology, results, limitations)

**Human Touchpoints:**
- Human selects which 3-5 papers to analyze from the ranked list
- Human reads AI's extractions and does their own consolidation
- Human manually writes the commercial feasibility analysis
- Human creates the use case validation document

**Interaction Pattern:**
User submits search → AI works asynchronously → AI presents ranked papers with extractions → User takes over for analysis and documentation

**Scope Boundaries:**
- **Does:** Search, retrieve, rank, extract key information
- **Doesn't:** Consolidate insights, assess commercial viability, draft documentation

---

### Hypothesis 2: AI Collaborative Analyst (Balanced)
**Autonomy Level:** AI as Collaborator (Level 2)

**What AI Does Autonomously:**
- Progressive hybrid processing: retrieves and analyzes papers in parallel
- Ranks 10-15 papers with scores and Chain-of-Thought explanations
- Consolidates insights across top 3-5 papers (cross-paper synthesis)
- Drafts complete commercial feasibility analysis (TAM/SAM/SOM, dev costs, regulatory, scalability)
- Generates use case validation document with all sections populated
- Adapts behavior based on entry point (browse/problem-search/upload)

**Human Touchpoints:**
- Human reviews ranked papers, can question exclusions ("Why not paper X?")
- Human selects final 3-5 papers or accepts AI's recommendation
- Human reviews and refines AI's consolidated analysis
- Human validates and edits commercial feasibility assessment
- Human approves final use case document before submission

**Interaction Pattern:**
User initiates → AI works progressively (shows streaming progress) → AI presents consolidated analysis + draft document → User refines iteratively → User approves final version

**Scope Boundaries:**
- **Does:** Full analysis pipeline from search to draft documentation
- **Doesn't:** Submit documents without human approval, make investment recommendations

---

### Hypothesis 3: AI Autonomous Analyst with Exception Handling (Aggressive)
**Autonomy Level:** AI as Agent (Level 3)

**What AI Does Autonomously:**
- Fully autonomous search, retrieval, ranking, analysis, and documentation
- Auto-selects top 3-5 papers using LLM-as-judge validation
- Generates complete use case validation document
- Self-assesses confidence levels for each section
- Only surfaces to human when confidence is below threshold or edge cases detected
- Caches analysis for popular papers to improve performance
- Proactively suggests problems that research could solve (not just reactive to user queries)

**Human Touchpoints:**
- Human sets initial parameters (industry focus, investment criteria, confidence thresholds)
- Human reviews only flagged exceptions or low-confidence analyses
- Human does final validation before investor submission (compliance checkpoint)
- Human provides feedback on AI decisions to improve future performance

**Interaction Pattern:**
User sets parameters once → AI runs autonomously for multiple searches → AI surfaces exceptions: "Found 3 promising opportunities, 1 needs your review" → User reviews exceptions and finals only

**Scope Boundaries:**
- **Does:** End-to-end autonomous workflow with self-assessment
- **Doesn't:** Submit to investors without human checkpoint, handle investor communication, make binding commitments

---

### Hypothesis 4: Multi-Agent System - 3 Core Agents (Specialist)

**Orchestration:** n8n workflow managing agent coordination and state

**Scope Boundaries:**
- **Does:** End-to-end from search to documentation with specialized agents and human validation checkpoints
- **Doesn't:** Submit without approval, handle investor communication

---

### Hypothesis 5: Multi-Agent System with Configurable Checkpoints (SELECTED)

- Final validation before investor submission

**Interaction Pattern:**
User initiates with checkpoint preference → Agents work progressively showing streaming progress → **Workflow PAUSES at each checkpoint** → User reviews and provides input (approve/refine/reject) → Agents proceed or re-process → Final human approval required

**Detail Level:**
- Configurable by user preference (summary with drill-down OR full details upfront)

**n8n Implementation:**
- Blocking checkpoints using Wait nodes with webhooks/forms
- State persisted between checkpoints
- User receives notification when checkpoint reached

**Scope Boundaries:**

## Chosen Solution

### Solution Name: Research-to-Market AI Marketplace (Phased Implementation)

**Marketplace Components:**
1. **Phase 1:** Multi-Agent Research Analysis System for Industry Partners (Current focus)
2. **Phase 2:** Investor Discovery & Matching System (Future)
3. **Phase 3:** Researcher Submission & Matching System (Future)
4. **Phase 4:** Full Marketplace with Network Effects (Future)

### Solution Logic (Phase 1)
"If we implement a **Multi-Agent Research Analysis System in phases** (starting with a single collaborative agent MVP, then evolving to 3 specialized agents with configurable checkpoints), it will produce **faster, higher-quality use case validation documents for industry partners** because **the AI handles time-consuming paper retrieval, PDF comprehension, and commercial feasibility drafting, while configurable human checkpoints ensure accuracy and build trust as we learn the n8n platform**. These validated documents become the foundation for the marketplace, enabling investor discovery and researcher matching in future phases."

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **Autonomy level chosen:** Collaborator (Level 2) - AI drafts and proposes, human reviews and approves
- **What we're optimizing for:** Learning curve management + meaningful impact
- **What we're accepting:**
  - Phased rollout means full vision takes 3-4 weeks instead of immediate deployment
  - Initial MVP has limited scope (1-3 papers) to validate approach
  - More human checkpoints initially (can reduce as trust builds)
  - Learning n8n while building (accepts some trial-and-error)

---

## Phase 1: Single Collaborative Agent MVP (Weeks 1-2)

- Commercial analysis: TAM/SAM/SOM via market research, dev costs, regulatory hurdles
- Processes multiple papers in parallel
- **Output:** Detailed technical + commercial assessment per paper

**Agent 3: Synthesis & Documentation Agent**
- Consolidates Agent 2 outputs
- Ranks 10-15 papers with Chain-of-Thought explanations and LLM-as-judge validation
- Handles "Why not paper X?" queries
- Cross-paper synthesis for selected top 3-5 papers
- Generates complete investor-ready use case validation document
- **Output:** Ranked papers + consolidated analysis + final documentation

### Configurable Checkpoint Levels:

**Minimum (3 checkpoints):**
1. After Agent 1: Validate retrieved papers
2. After Agent 3 Ranking: Select final 3-5 papers
3. After Agent 3 Documentation: Final approval

**Standard (4 checkpoints):**
1. After Agent 1: Validate retrieved papers
2. After Agent 2: Validate individual analyses
3. After Agent 3 Ranking: Select final 3-5 papers
4. After Agent 3 Documentation: Final approval

**Maximum (5 checkpoints):**
1. After Agent 1: Validate retrieved papers
2. After Agent 2: Validate individual analyses
3. After Agent 3 Ranking: Select final 3-5 papers
4. After Agent 3 Consolidation: Validate synthesis
5. After Agent 3 Documentation: Final approval

### Human-in-the-Loop Touchpoints:
- **Workflow Start:** User configures checkpoint level (min/standard/max)
- **At Each Checkpoint:** Workflow blocks, user reviews and decides (approve/refine/reject)
- **Detail Preference:** User configures view (summary with drill-down OR full details)
- **Final Validation:** Required before investor submission (compliance gate)

### Interaction Pattern:
User initiates with checkpoint preference + entry point (browse/problem-search/upload) → Agent 1 retrieves (streaming progress) → CHECKPOINT → Agent 2 analyzes in parallel (streaming progress) → CHECKPOINT (if configured) → Agent 3 ranks → CHECKPOINT → User selects 3-5 papers → Agent 3 consolidates → CHECKPOINT (if configured) → Agent 3 documents → FINAL CHECKPOINT → User approves

### Additional Capabilities (Phase 2):
- **Adaptive Entry Points:**
  - Browse: Pre-curated trending research, less aggressive filtering
  - Problem-search: Aggressive filtering by problem-solution fit
  - Upload: Analyze provided paper + suggest related research
- **Cross-paper Synthesis:** Consolidate insights across 3-5 papers
- **Explainability:** "Why wasn't paper X included?" query handling
- **Performance:** Caching for popular papers, parallel processing
- **Scalability:** Handle 10-15 papers end-to-end

### Success Metrics:
- **Scale validation:** Successfully process 10-15 papers end-to-end
- **Time savings:** Measure time reduction vs manual workflow (target: 60-80% reduction)
- **Quality:** Investor-ready documents that pass human validation
- **Flexibility:** Users can successfully adjust checkpoint levels based on trust/experience
- **Architecture:** Demonstrate clean agent handoffs and state management in n8n

### n8n Advanced Learning Objectives:
- Multi-agent coordination and handoffs
- Parallel execution patterns (Agent 2 analyzing multiple papers simultaneously)
- Advanced state management across agents
- Configurable workflow paths based on user preferences
- Performance optimization patterns

### Scope Boundaries:

**Phase 2 DOES:**
- Full multi-agent architecture (3 specialized agents)
- Scale to 10-15 papers with parallel processing
- Configurable checkpoints (3-5 levels)
- Adaptive entry point workflows
- Cross-paper synthesis and consolidation
- Complete investor-ready documentation
- Performance optimization (caching, parallel processing)
- Explainable rankings with LLM-as-judge

**Phase 2 DOESN'T:**
- Investor matching workflow (separate workflow - deferred)
- Partnership facilitation (separate workflow - deferred)
- Automatic submission to investors (human approval always required)
- Investor communication
- Handle non-technology research papers (AI/ML focus maintained)

## Experiment Plan

### Core Assumption Being Tested
"n8n can handle the Phase 1 MVP workflow: retrieve research papers from arXiv/Semantic Scholar, analyze PDFs with multimodal LLM (Claude vision/GPT-4V), implement blocking checkpoints with webhooks/forms, and generate outputs."

**Key Uncertainties:**
1. Can n8n implement blocking checkpoints (pause workflow, wait for user input via webhook/form)?
2. Can multimodal LLMs (Claude/GPT-4V) process research PDFs with images, tables, and mathematical content effectively?
3. Is the n8n learning curve manageable for building this workflow in 1 week?
4. Can the workflow scale to Phase 1 MVP requirements (3 checkpoints, 1-3 papers, full analysis)?

### Experiment Design

**What we're testing:**
Can n8n successfully orchestrate the core research analysis loop with human-in-the-loop checkpoints and multimodal PDF processing?

**How we'll test it:**
Build a minimal n8n workflow with simplified scope:

**Simplified Workflow:**
1. **Input:** User provides search query (topic/problem) via n8n form/webhook trigger
2. **Retrieval:**
   - HTTP request to arXiv API and/or Semantic Scholar API
   - Retrieve 1-2 papers only (minimal scope for testing)
   - Extract PDF URLs and metadata (title, abstract, authors)
3. **CHECKPOINT 1 (Blocking):**
   - Display retrieved papers with titles/abstracts to user
   - User reviews via webhook form: Approve / Refine search / Remove papers
   - Workflow pauses until user responds
4. **PDF Processing & Analysis:**
   - Download PDF or pass PDF URL to multimodal LLM
   - Test both Claude (Anthropic) with vision AND GPT-4V (OpenAI) to determine best option
   - LLM analyzes: extract text, images, tables, mathematical proofs
   - LLM performs technical analysis (methodology, results, limitations, technical feasibility, scalability)
   - LLM drafts basic commercial feasibility (problem-solution fit, development cost estimate, regulatory flags)
5. **CHECKPOINT 2 (Blocking):**
   - Display analysis to user
   - User reviews via webhook form: Approve / Request re-analysis / Add context
   - Workflow pauses until user responds
6. **Output Generation:**
   - Generate markdown summary document with sections: Problem Addressed, Methodology, Results, Technical Feasibility, Commercial Viability
7. **CHECKPOINT 3 (Blocking):**
   - Display final summary
   - User reviews via webhook form: Approve / Edit / Regenerate
   - Workflow pauses until user responds

**Sample size:** 2-3 search queries in AI/ML domain

**Test Queries:**
1. "multimodal learning vision language models" (should return papers with diagrams/architectures)
2. "reinforcement learning robotics" (should return papers with tables/results)
3. "graph neural networks recommendation systems" (should return papers with mathematical notation)

**Duration:** 1 week (7 days)
- **Days 1-2:** Learn n8n basics (HTTP nodes, LLM nodes, Wait nodes, webhooks, form triggers)
- **Days 3-5:** Build the workflow (implement all 3 checkpoints, test PDF processing with Claude/GPT-4V)
- **Day 6:** Test with 2-3 queries, document PDF processing quality
- **Day 7:** Analyze findings, document decision on proceeding to Phase 1 MVP

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metric:**
- **Workflow Completion (Yes/No):** Can successfully run end-to-end from query → retrieval → checkpoints → analysis → output

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **Checkpoint Implementation Quality (1-10 rating):** Do blocking checkpoints work smoothly? Is the webhook/form UX acceptable?
- **State Persistence (Pass/Fail):** Does workflow maintain state across checkpoints?
- **API Integration Reliability (Success rate):** Do arXiv/Semantic Scholar APIs work reliably?
- **PDF Processing Quality (1-10 rating):** Can multimodal LLM capture images, tables, equations from research PDFs?
- **Analysis Usefulness (1-10 rating):** Does LLM analysis capture key insights accurately?
- **Learning Curve (Hours spent):** How long to build as n8n beginner?
- **Confidence to Scale (1-10 rating):** Does it feel feasible to build Phase 1 MVP (3 checkpoints, 1-3 papers, full commercial analysis)?

**What to Document During Experiment:**
- Time spent on each phase (learning, building, testing, debugging)
- Blockers encountered and solutions found
- Screenshots of working checkpoints (workflow paused state, form submission, workflow resuming)
- PDF processing comparison: Claude vs GPT-4V quality for multimodal content
- Sample analysis outputs (save markdown summaries)
- Error logs and failure modes
- Confidence level (1-10) in scaling to Phase 1 MVP

### Success Criteria

**Experiment succeeds if:**
- ✅ Successfully build the workflow in n8n within 1 week
- ✅ Blocking checkpoints work (workflow pauses, waits for webhook/form response, continues with state intact)
- ✅ Retrieved papers are relevant to search queries
- ✅ Multimodal LLM (Claude or GPT-4V) successfully processes PDFs with images/tables/math
- ✅ LLM analysis captures key paper insights (methodology, results, feasibility) with acceptable accuracy
- ✅ Confidence level ≥ 7/10 in ability to build Phase 1 MVP

**Experiment fails if:**
- ❌ Cannot implement blocking checkpoints in n8n (technical limitation discovered)
- ❌ Multimodal LLM cannot process research PDFs adequately (images/tables/math not captured)
- ❌ Workflow is too brittle (breaks frequently, debugging is too difficult)
- ❌ Learning curve too steep (cannot build working version in 1 week)
- ❌ Confidence level < 5/10 in scaling to Phase 1 MVP

**Mixed results if:**
- ⚠️ Workflow works but feels clunky (UX issues, but functional - document pain points)
- ⚠️ Some parts work well, others struggle (identify what needs different approach)
- ⚠️ PDF processing works for simple papers but fails on complex ones (tables/equations problematic)
- ⚠️ Checkpoint blocking works but state management is fragile
- ⚠️ Confidence level 5-6/10 (uncertain but possible)

### Tools & Setup Required

**n8n Setup:**
- n8n cloud account or self-hosted instance (✅ Already have)
- Access to n8n workflow editor

**API Keys Needed:**
- Anthropic API key (for Claude with vision) - **TBD: Check if have access**
- OpenAI API key (for GPT-4V with vision) - **TBD: Check if have access**
- arXiv API (no key needed - public API)
- Semantic Scholar API (free tier - may need registration)

**Pre-Experiment Setup Tasks:**
1. Verify/obtain Anthropic API key for Claude
2. Verify/obtain OpenAI API key for GPT-4V (if testing both)
3. Test basic n8n HTTP node with arXiv API (simple query)
4. Test basic n8n LLM node with Claude/GPT (simple prompt)
5. Research n8n Wait node + webhook patterns for blocking checkpoints

### Next Steps Based on Outcomes

**If Successful (Confidence ≥ 7/10):**
1. **Proceed to Phase 1 MVP build in n8n**
   - Use experiment workflow as foundation
   - Scale to 1-3 papers (from 2 in experiment)
   - Implement full commercial feasibility analysis with external market research
   - Add structured JSON output format (in addition to markdown)
   - Polish checkpoint UX based on learnings
2. **Select winning PDF processing method** (Claude vs GPT-4V based on experiment results)
3. **Create Phase 1 implementation plan** with timeline
4. **Move to Step 6: Workflow Generation** (generate YAML workflow)

**If It Fails (Cannot build or Confidence < 5/10):**
1. **Analyze root cause:**
   - Is it n8n specifically (technical limitations)?
   - Is it multimodal PDF processing (LLM capabilities)?
   - Is it the learning curve (need different tool)?
2. **Pivot options:**
   - **Option A:** Try LangGraph instead (Python-based, more control, but steeper learning curve)
   - **Option B:** Custom Python orchestration (FastAPI + Celery for background jobs + simple UI)
   - **Option C:** Simpler no-code alternative (Make.com, Zapier if they support blocking better)
   - **Option D:** Simplify architecture (remove blocking checkpoints, use async notifications instead)
   - **Option E:** Hybrid approach (n8n for orchestration, external service for PDF processing)
3. **Run second experiment** with chosen alternative

**If Mixed Results (Confidence 5-6/10):**
1. **Document specific pain points:**
   - What worked well?
   - What was problematic?
   - What workarounds are needed?
2. **Decide if pain points are acceptable:**
   - Can workarounds be implemented?
   - Will issues compound when scaling to 3 agents?
3. **Iteration options:**
   - Refine the experiment (address specific failure modes)
   - Simplify scope further for Phase 1 (reduce ambition)
   - Accept limitations and proceed with caution
4. **Run focused follow-up test** on the problematic area (e.g., just test checkpoint state management deeply)

### Experiment Success Indicator
