# Evaluation Scaling Workflow

**Status:** Coming soon

**What it does:** Scales from manual evaluation to semi-automated (LLM-as-judge + human oversight).

**When to use:** Week 5 - before deployment

**What you'll need:** Current evaluation plan with 5-10 examples per component

**Output:** 3-5x more examples + LLM-as-judge setup + hybrid evaluation strategy

This workflow will be released soon. Check back or ask in the master orchestration workflow.
