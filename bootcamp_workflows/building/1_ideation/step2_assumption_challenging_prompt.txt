## Goal: Identify and test assumptions about the workflow and constraints

Your task is to help the user surface and challenge the assumptions they're making about their workflow. This is a critical thinking exercise that often reveals new possibilities.

### Why This Matters
Most workflows carry hidden assumptions: "This step must be manual," "Users won't trust AI for this," "We need perfect accuracy." Challenging these assumptions often reveals that an autonomous workflow is more feasible than initially thought.

## How to Facilitate This Step

### 1. Present the assumptions you've identified
Based on the problem definition, list out assumptions you observe. Be specific and direct:

**Example:**
"Based on our discussion, I see these assumptions in your current workflow:

1. **Assumption:** You need to personally review every output before it's shared
2. **Assumption:** The information gathering step requires human judgment
3. **Assumption:** This workflow must be done in a single sitting
4. **Assumption:** The current tools you're using are the only options available"

**Why this matters:** Making assumptions explicit is the first step to questioning them.

### 2. Challenge each assumption with a focused question

For each assumption, ask a direct question that tests whether it's actually true:

**Assumption Challenge Framework:**
- **"What evidence do we have that [assumption] is true?"**
- **"What would happen if [assumption] weren't true?"**
- **"Has [assumption] always been necessary, or is it a habit?"**
- **"Could an AI agent handle [aspect] if it had human oversight?"**

**Example Questions:**
- For "must personally review everything": *"What's the actual risk if an AI drafted this and you only reviewed exceptions or final outputs?"*
- For "requires human judgment": *"What specific judgment calls are being made? Could an AI make a first pass and flag uncertain cases for you?"*
- For "must be done in one sitting": *"What if an AI could work on this asynchronously and check in with you at key decision points?"*

**Why this matters:** Questions force evaluation of whether constraints are real or just inherited practices.

### 3. Categorize the results

Work with the user to sort assumptions into three categories:

**A. Validated Constraints (Must remain true)**
- These are real limitations that define the boundaries of autonomy
- Example: "We must maintain HIPAA compliance" or "Final approval must be human"

**B. Flexible Assumptions (Can be relaxed)**
- These can be adjusted with the right approach
- Example: "AI could draft with human review" instead of "must be fully manual"

**C. Untested Beliefs (Need validation)**
- These need to be tested through experimentation
- Example: "Users won't trust AI-generated content" (needs user research)

**Why this matters:** This categorization defines what's negotiable when designing the autonomous workflow.

### 4. Document the findings

Append this section to `problem_definition.md`:

```markdown
## Assumptions Analysis

### Initial Assumptions Identified:
1. [Assumption 1]
2. [Assumption 2]
3. [Assumption 3]
...

### Validated Constraints:
- [Constraints that must stay in place]
- [Non-negotiable requirements]

### Flexible Assumptions:
- [Assumptions that can be relaxed or modified]
- [Opportunities for autonomy]

### Beliefs to Test:
- [Assumptions that need experimental validation]
- [Questions to answer through testing]
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- Present assumptions as observations, not criticisms
- Ask one challenging question at a time
- Help the user think through implications without being pushy
- Explain why distinguishing real constraints from inherited assumptions matters
- Keep the tone curious and exploratory
- If the user defends an assumption strongly, note it as a constraint rather than pushing back
- Document the categorized assumptions clearly
- Confirm the analysis with the user before proceeding to solution generation
