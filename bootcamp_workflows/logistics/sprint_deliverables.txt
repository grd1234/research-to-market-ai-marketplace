## Logistics Reference: Sprint Deliverables

**Instructions for AI Assistant:**
Read this reference material silently. After reading, say something brief like: "Ready to answer questions about sprint deliverables—what would you like to know?" Then answer their questions naturally. They may ask about specific sprints or requirements.

## SPRINT 1 DELIVERABLES (End of Week 2)

**What to show:** Minimal prototype of your application

**Required by demo:**
1. **Prototype Demo Video (2 min max)**
   - Showcase working prototype
   - Explain functionality and expected behavior
   - Show design decisions

2. **Sprint 1 Report**
   - Generated by workflows (ideation, evaluation, implementation)
   - Documents problem definition, evaluation results, prototype status

3. **Open Questions (1-2 targeted questions)**
   - Examples:
     - "How can I make my agent do X consistently?"
     - "Does Y need to be an agent or a tool?"
     - "I wasn't able to do Z in no-code, what's the best approach?"

**Submission:** Post report + video link (with proper access) to Slack cohort channel

**It doesn't need to be perfect—just show what you're working on to get feedback.**

## SPRINT 2 DELIVERABLES (End of Week 4)

**What to show:** Functional prototype (MVP level)

**Required by demo:**
1. **Prototype Demo Video (2 min max)**
   - Show working prototype
   - Explain functionality and behavior
   - Highlight what's improved since Sprint 1

2. **Sprint 2 Report**
   - Generated by workflows (user research, component evaluation, architecture iteration)
   - Documents user feedback, refinements, evaluation improvements

3. **Open Questions (1-2 targeted questions)**
   - Examples:
     - "How can I improve evaluation criteria for my agent?"
     - "Are there better ways to design the workflow for efficiency?"
     - "How do I handle failure cases or edge scenarios?"

**Submission:** Post report + video link to Slack cohort channel

**Goal: Have something functional you can test with users, not feature-complete.**

## SPRINT 3 DELIVERABLES (End of Week 6)

**What to show:** Deployed prototype, almost ready for public demo

**Required by demo:**
1. **Deployed Prototype Demo Video (2 min max)**
   - Show deployed system
   - Explain functionality and behavior
   - Highlight deployment and production considerations

2. **Sprint 3 Report**
   - Generated by workflows (evaluation scaling, deployment, cost optimization)
   - Documents deployment details, cost analysis, scaled evaluation results

3. **Open Questions (1-2 targeted questions)**
   - Examples:
     - "How can I reduce latency in my app?"
     - "How can I reduce operational cost?"
     - "Would it be more engaging to show A or B in final demo?"

**Submission:** Post report + video link to Slack cohort channel

**This is your dry run for the public demo—get feedback on presentation.**

---

## FINAL DEMO DELIVERABLES (Week 7)

**What to show:** Complete journey in 8-minute public presentation

**Required:**
1. **Demo Video (8 min max)**
   - **Note: Hard cutoff at 8 minutes during playback—finish earlier to be safe!**

2. **Demo Card**
   - Generated by demo prep workflow
   - Contains project summary, key insights, links

**Submission:** Will be handled by demo preparation workflow

**Suggested Video Structure:**

**1. Problem Statement (1 min)**
- Who has this problem?
- Why does it matter?
- Cost of not solving it

**2. Solution Architecture (2 min)**
- Workflow diagram
- Key components
- Novel approach or insights

**3. Live Demo (2 min)**
- ONE compelling example end-to-end
- Highlight 1-2 interesting details

**4. Validation (1 min)**
- Evaluation results
- User feedback quote
- Performance metrics

**5. Learnings & Challenges (1 min)**
- Biggest technical challenge overcome
- Most surprising discovery
- Key insight about building with LLMs

**6. The Ask (1 min)**
- What's next for the project?
- Who do you need to connect with?
- How can audience help?

## RECORDING TIPS

**Tools:** Loom works great for recording

**Preparation:**
- Use headphones/high-quality mic for clear audio
- Close unnecessary windows, organize screen
- Can use AI voice cloning if needed (not encouraged but allowed)
- Can record in segments and fuse together (ensure continuity)

**Timing:** Practice multiple times—8 minutes goes fast!

---

## FORMAT FOR ALL SPRINT DEMOS

**Duration:**
- Sprint demos: 2 min video + discussion
- Final demo: 8 min video + 2 min Q&A

**Audience:**
- Sprint demos: Cohort + instructors
- Final demo: Public (community, guests, potential collaborators)

**Outcome:**
- Sprint demos: Feedback to improve
- Final demo: Recorded, published on YouTube, networking opportunity

## WHAT IF I'M BEHIND?

**Sprint 1 missed:** Catch up ASAP—this is the critical filter for completion
**Sprint 2 missed:** Can still catch up for Sprint 3 and final
**Sprint 3 missed:** Focus all energy on making final demo great

**The goal is completion, not perfection. Show what you have, get feedback, iterate.**

---

## SUBMISSION PROCESS

**Sprint Demos (1, 2, 3):**
1. Run relevant workflows to generate report
2. Record video (respect time limits!)
3. Upload video with download access
4. Post report + video link to Slack cohort channel
5. Submit by deadline (usually 1pm ET on demo day)

**Final Demo:**
1. Run demo preparation workflow to generate demo card
2. Record final video
3. Submission handled by demo workflow

**Missing submission = harder to get feedback = harder to improve.**

---

**Note:** The workflows you run will automatically generate the reports you need for each sprint. Focus on running the workflows and building your project—the documentation will come together naturally.
