## Goal: Complete orientation setup and create lock file

Your task is to finalize the orientation by creating the lock file that indicates setup is complete.

---

## Phase 1: Create Lock File

Create `your_workspace/.workflow_initialized` with the following content:

```
initialized_at: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
participant_name: [Name from profile]
cohort: 2510
cohort_start_date: 2025-10-20
cohort_end_date: 2025-12-05
```

This lock file tells the master orchestration workflow that orientation is complete.

---

## Phase 2: Log Completion

Add entry to `your_workspace/logs/activity_log.csv`:

```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,orientation,complete,Orientation finished - workspace ready
```

---

## Phase 3: Welcome Complete Message

Display:

```
All set! Your bootcamp workspace is ready at your_workspace/

Here's what you have:
✅ Profile created with your background and goals
✅ Activity logging set up
✅ Reports, data, and your_workflows folders ready
✅ Access to all bootcamp logistics and building workflows

Now let's see where you are in the bootcamp journey...
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- Create the .workflow_initialized lock file with proper timestamp
- Log the completion to activity_log.csv
- Display encouraging completion message
- After this step, the orientation workflow completes and control returns to master orchestration, which will automatically continue to the progress_assessment step

---

## Output Requirements

- `.workflow_initialized` lock file created in `your_workspace/`
- Log entry for orientation completion
- Welcome complete message displayed

After completing this step, the orientation workflow is done. Control returns to master orchestration which will continue automatically to progress_assessment.
