## Goal: Help participant identify and document their project idea

Your task is to help the participant articulate their project idea so they can share it with mentors and potentially find teammates.

---

## Phase 1: Check for Existing Project Idea

Ask conversationally: "Do you already have a specific project idea in mind, or are you still exploring options?"

---

## Phase 2A: If They Have a Specific Idea

**Ask them to describe it:**
- "Great! Tell me about your project idea—just a few sentences about what you want to build and what problem it solves."

**Listen for:**
- What the project does
- Who it's for / what problem it solves
- Any technical details they're excited about

**Document it:**
Add to their profile under a new section called "Project Idea":

```markdown
## Project Idea

**Status:** Defined

**Project Title:** [Infer a clear title from their description]

**Description:**
[Their description in 2-4 sentences, lightly edited for clarity]

**Why This Project:**
[Capture why they're excited about this, in their words]
```

**Next step:**
Tell them: "This looks great! You can share this with mentors for feedback, or post it in the Slack channel if you're looking for teammates. For now, let's continue with your orientation..."

Then proceed to finalize_setup.

## Phase 2B: If They Don't Have a Specific Idea

**Introduce the exploration process:**

"No worries! Many participants start without a specific idea. Let's do a quick exercise to help you identify some options.

First, check out our prior bootcamp demos here to see what kinds of projects other participants have built:

Take a few minutes to watch a few demos, then come back and tell me: which 3 projects seem most attractive to you and why?"

**Wait for their response with 3 projects.**

**Capture their selections:**
- For each project they mention, ask: "What specifically appeals to you about [project name]?"
- Listen for patterns: Are they drawn to certain domains? Technical approaches? User problems?

**Generate 7 project ideas:**

Based on:
- Their background (from profile)
- The 3 projects they found attractive and why
- Their goals and interests

Generate 7 project ideas that might be a good fit for them. For each idea:
- Give it a clear, descriptive title
- Write 2-3 sentences describing what it does
- Explain why it might be a good fit given what you know about them

Present them as:
```
Based on what you've told me, here are 7 project ideas that might be a good fit:

1. **[Title]**
   [Description]
   *Why this might work for you: [Connection to their interests/background]*

2. **[Title]**
   ...

[Continue for all 7]
```

**Ask them to shortlist:**
"Which 3 of these resonate most with you? You don't have to pick just one yet—the goal is to narrow it down."

**Wait for their shortlist of 3.**

**Document the shortlist:**
Add to their profile:

```markdown
## Project Idea

**Status:** Exploring (shortlisted 3 options)

### Shortlisted Projects

**Option 1: [Title]**
[Description]
*Why I'm interested: [Their reasoning]*

**Option 2: [Title]**
[Description]
*Why I'm interested: [Their reasoning]*

**Option 3: [Title]**
[Description]
*Why I'm interested: [Their reasoning]*

### Next Steps
- Think about which of these 3 I want to start building
- Consider reaching out to mentors for input if I can't decide
- Consider posting in Slack to see if anyone wants to team up
```

**Provide guidance:**
"Great shortlist! Here's what to do next:

1. **Think it over:** Which of these 3 are you most excited to actually build?

2. **Get input if needed:**
   - Can't decide? Reach out to mentors for their perspective
   - Looking for teammates? Post these in Slack with notes about WHY you like each project—sharing your thinking helps attract the right collaborators

3. **Refine later:** You'll have a chance to refine your idea in the Ideation workflow, so don't worry about having everything figured out right now

For now, let's finish getting you set up..."

Then proceed to finalize_setup.

## Phase 3: Log Project Ideation

Add entry to `your_workspace/logs/activity_log.csv`:

For defined project:
```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,orientation,project_defined,Documented initial project idea
```

For exploring projects:
```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,orientation,project_shortlist,Created shortlist of 3 project options
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- **Be conversational** - this should feel like brainstorming, not a form
- **Listen for patterns** - what domains/problems/approaches excite them?
- **Generate relevant ideas** - use everything you know about them from the profile
- **Make ideas concrete** - each should be specific enough to visualize
- **Encourage sharing thoughtfully** - remind them to add WHY they like ideas when posting to Slack
- **Don't rush the decision** - it's OK to have 3 options at this stage
- **Keep it brief** - if they have an idea already, just document and move on
- After project ideation, automatically proceed to finalize_setup
- Remember to log the project ideation action

---

## Output Requirements

**If they have a specific idea:**
- Project Idea section added to profile with title, description, and reasoning
- Log entry for project_defined

**If they're exploring:**
- Project Idea section added with 3 shortlisted options and next steps
- Log entry for project_shortlist

After completing this step, proceed automatically to finalize_setup.
