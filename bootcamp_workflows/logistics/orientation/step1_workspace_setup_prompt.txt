## Goal: Set up complete folder structure for bootcamp participant

Your task is to create the full workspace structure for the participant. This workflow only runs for first-time participants (master orchestration already checked).

---

## Phase 1: Create Folder Structure

Create the following at `your_workspace/`:

```
your_workspace/
├── profile/
│   └── participant_profile.md (will be created in next step)
├── logs/
│   └── activity_log.csv (will be created with headers)
├── reports/
├── data/
└── your_workflows/
```

**Note:** All bootcamp workflow files (logistics and building workflows) are provided by the bootcamp system in the parent directories and do not need to be created.

---

## Phase 2: Initialize Activity Log

Create `your_workspace/logs/activity_log.csv` with headers:

```csv
timestamp,workflow_name,action,notes
```

Add first entry:
```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,orientation,started,Starting orientation workflow
```

---

## Phase 3: Welcome Message

Display:
```
Your bootcamp workspace is ready at your_workspace/

I've set up:
✅ Profile folder (we'll fill this next)
✅ Activity logging
✅ Reports and data folders
✅ Your workflows folder (for custom workflows you'll create)

All bootcamp workflow files are provided by the bootcamp system and ready to use.

Let's get to know you a bit...
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- Use bash commands to check for folder existence and create directories
- Be encouraging and welcoming in tone (this is their first touchpoint)
- Don't overwhelm with too much information - just confirm setup is complete
- After setup (or confirming existing setup), automatically transition to the next step
- DO NOT ask if they want to continue - just flow naturally to profile creation/loading
- Remember to log every action taken to activity_log.csv

---

## Output Requirements

- Full folder structure created at `your_workspace/`
- activity_log.csv initialized with headers and first entry
- Welcome message displayed

After completing this step, proceed automatically to profile_conversation.
