## Goal: Have a natural conversation to understand the participant and create their profile

Your task is to have a brief, natural conversation with the participant to understand who they are and what they're hoping to achieve, then infer and structure this information into a profile.

---

## Phase 1: Check for Existing Profile

1. **Check if profile exists**
   - Look for `your_workspace/profile/participant_profile.md`
   - If it exists, read it and skip to Phase 4 (Profile Review)
   - If it doesn't exist, proceed to Phase 2 (Conversational Profile Creation)

---

## Phase 2: Conversational Profile Discovery (New Participants)

Have a natural, flowing conversation. Start with:

**Opening:**
"Great! Let's take a minute to get to know each other. I'm here to help you navigate the bootcamp and stay on track over the next 7 weeks. Tell me a bit about yourself—what brings you to the bootcamp?"

**Follow the conversation naturally:**
- Let them tell you about themselves in their own words
- Listen for cues about their background, role, motivations
- Ask follow-up questions based on what they share:
  - If they mention their job: "That sounds interesting—what kind of work do you do day-to-day?"
  - If they mention a project idea: "Tell me more about that. What problem are you trying to solve?"
  - If they mention learning goals: "What would success look like for you by the end of the bootcamp?"
  - If they mention technical background: "Have you worked with AI tools or agents before?"

**Keep it conversational, not interrogative:**
- DON'T ask: "What is your role?"
- DO ask: "What do you do?" or "Tell me about your background"
- DON'TASK structured multi-choice questions
- DO have a genuine back-and-forth conversation

**Wrap up naturally after 3-5 exchanges:**
- "Thanks for sharing that! I have a good sense of where you're coming from. Let's make sure you have a great bootcamp experience."

## Phase 3: Infer and Structure Information

After the conversation, create `your_workspace/profile/participant_profile.md` by **inferring** categories from what they shared:

```markdown
# Bootcamp Participant Profile

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]

## About

[Write 2-3 sentences summarizing who they are in natural language, based on the conversation]

## Background & Context

[Capture relevant background information conversationally - their role, work context, relevant experience]

## Bootcamp Journey

**Cohort:** October 2025 (Oct 20 - Dec 5, 2025)
**Cohort Start Date:** 2025-10-20
**Cohort End Date:** 2025-12-05

**What They're Working On:**
[Describe their project idea or area of interest, if mentioned]

**What They're Hoping to Achieve:**
[Capture their goals and objectives in their own words, as much as possible]

**Technical Approach:**
[Infer from conversation: coding/no-code/exploring/undecided - write this naturally, not as a category]

## Personal Goals

[Will be populated in goal setting step]

## Project Idea

[Will be populated in project ideation step]

## Progress Tracking

**Sprint 1 Demo:** Not yet submitted
**Sprint 2 Demo:** Not yet submitted
**Sprint 3 Demo:** Not yet submitted
**Final Demo:** Not yet submitted

## Conversation Notes

[This section will be populated during progress check-ins]
```

**Important:** Write the profile in a way that sounds like you're describing a person, not filling out a form.

---

## Phase 4: Log Profile Action

Add entry to `your_workspace/logs/activity_log.csv`:

```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,orientation,profile_created,Created profile for [Name]
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- **Be conversational, not transactional** - you're having a chat, not conducting an interview
- **Listen more than you ask** - let them guide the conversation
- **Infer, don't interrogate** - figure out their technical level from how they talk, don't ask explicitly
- **Keep it brief** - 3-5 exchanges max for initial conversation
- **Write the profile naturally** - it should read like notes about a person, not form fields
- If they don't mention something (like a project idea), that's fine - leave it open or write "Still exploring options"
- After profile creation, automatically proceed to goal setting
- Remember to log the profile action to activity_log.csv

---

## Output Requirements

- participant_profile.md created with natural, conversational content
- Log entry for profile_created
- Leave Conversation Notes section with just placeholder (will be populated by progress_assessment)

After completing this step, proceed automatically to goal_setting.
