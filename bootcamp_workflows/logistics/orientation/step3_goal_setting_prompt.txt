## Goal: Help participant set realistic personal goals for the bootcamp in a conversational way

Your task is to have a brief conversation about what success looks like for them, then help them set weekly goals that align with both their personal objectives and the bootcamp structure.

---

## Phase 1: Read Context

1. **Load their profile**
   - Read `your_workspace/profile/participant_profile.md`
   - Understand what they're hoping to achieve (from the profile)

2. **Understand bootcamp structure**
   - 7 weeks total (Oct 20 - Dec 5, 2025)
   - 3 sprints (2 weeks each) + demo week
   - Key milestones: Sprint 1 demo (Week 2), Sprint 2 demo (Week 4), Sprint 3 demo (Week 6), Final demo (Week 7)

---

## Phase 2: Conversational Goal Setting

**Opening** (reference their profile naturally):
- "So you're here to [reference their objective from profile]. That's great!"
- "The bootcamp is 7 weeks, and it moves pretty fast. Let's think about what you want to accomplish week by week."

**Explore their commitment level:**
- "How much time do you think you can realistically put into this each week?"
- Listen for cues: 5-10 hours? 10-15 hours? Just weekends? Full-time?
- DON'T judge—just help them set realistic expectations

**Help them think through milestones:**
- "The bootcamp has 3 sprint demos and a final demo. What would you want to show at each one?"
- Let them describe in their own words
- Help them break down if too ambitious: "That sounds amazing—let's think about what the simplest version of that looks like for Sprint 1"

**Weekly rhythm:**
- "Most successful participants check in on Mondays, work through the week, and prep for demos on weekends. Does that rhythm work for you?"
- Adapt to their schedule if different

**Wrap up:**
- "Alright, so if I'm understanding right, your goals are: [summarize in their language]"
- "We can always adjust these as we go—this is just to help you stay on track. Sound good?"

## Phase 3: Update Profile with Goals

Update the **Personal Goals** section in `your_workspace/profile/participant_profile.md`:

```markdown
## Personal Goals

**Weekly Time Commitment:** [Inferred from conversation: e.g., "10-12 hours/week, mostly evenings and weekends"]

**Sprint Goals:**

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):**
[What they want to accomplish, in their words]

**Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):**
[What they want to accomplish]

**Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6):**
[What they want to accomplish]

**Final Demo (Week 7):**
[What they want to show/achieve]

**Weekly Check-in Rhythm:**
[When they plan to use this workflow: e.g., "Monday mornings before group session"]

**Personal Success Criteria:**
[What would make this bootcamp successful for them personally - beyond just completing it]
```

---

## Phase 4: Log Goal Setting

Add entry to `your_workspace/logs/activity_log.csv`:

```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,orientation,goals_set,Set personal goals for bootcamp
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- **Be realistic, not aspirational** - help them set goals they can actually achieve given their time
- **Don't overwhelm** - if they're unsure, suggest starting with Sprint 1 goals only
- **Use their language** - don't rewrite their goals in formal language, keep their phrasing
- **Be flexible** - if they want to adjust goals later, that's totally fine
- **Reference bootcamp structure** - help them understand what's realistic at each sprint
- **Keep it brief** - 4-5 exchanges max
- **No judgment** - whether they want to do 5 hours/week or 20 hours/week, support them
- After goal setting, automatically proceed to project_ideation
- Remember to log the goal-setting action

---

## Output Requirements

- Personal Goals section in participant_profile.md updated with conversational, realistic goals
- Log entry for goals_set

After completing this step, proceed automatically to project_ideation.
