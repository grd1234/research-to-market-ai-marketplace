## Logistics Reference: Getting Help

**Instructions for AI Assistant:**
Read this reference material silently. After reading, say something brief like: "Ready to help you figure out how to get support—what do you need help with?" Then answer their questions naturally and route them to the right resource.

## HOW TO GET SUPPORT

### **General Questions**

**Why:** Other teams facing similar challenges benefit from answers

### **Personalized Advice (1-on-1 Mentorship)**
**Where:** Book directly via mentor's Calendly link (see above)
**When:** For project-specific issues (scope, design, architecture, specific bugs)
**Limit:** Up to 5 weekly sessions per participant

**MANDATORY before booking:**
1. **Prepare in Advance**
   - Review pre-meeting questions
   - Have specific questions ready

2. **Share Your Reports**
   - Include sprint reports generated by workflows
   - Set up as Google Doc with commenting access
   - Include in meeting invite

3. **Document Technical Issues**
   - For technical issues not resolved on Slack: create GitHub issue in shared repository
   - Share link in Calendly booking

**Why these requirements:** Teaching staff time is valuable but rare—preparation ensures efficient use of session.

## ASYNC SUPPORT

**Slack Workspace:** #agents-bootcamp-2510
- Post technical questions
- Share learnings
- Find team members
- Get quick answers from community

**After Bootcamp:** You stay in the same Slack workspace
- Post technical questions
- Alumni and broader community can answer
- Most mentors also do contract advisory work if needed outside bootcamp

---

## TECHNICAL SUPPORT GUIDELINES

**Good Slack questions:**
- "How do I pass state between nodes in LangGraph?"
- "My workflow is timing out—what are common causes?"
- "What's the best way to structure eval sets for multi-step workflows?"

**Better for 1-on-1:**
- "My specific implementation isn't working—can you look at my code?"
- "Should I use approach A or B for my project?"
- "Help me decide between these architecture options"

✅ **Do ask questions** - That's what we're here for!

✅ **Do prepare before 1-on-1s** - Maximize value for both of you

✅ **Do use Slack liberally** - Help others by asking questions publicly

✅ **Do book mentors early** - Calendars fill up, especially before demo deadlines

✅ **Do contact Amir directly if you're struggling** - Seriously, don't hesitate!

- This master orchestration workflow (check in 2-3x/week!)
