- Hands-on practice with week's concepts
- Continue working independently throughout the week

**Wednesday (12-1pm ET): Build Standup**
- Share progress since Monday
- Troubleshoot blockers as cohort
- Get guidance on next steps

**Sunday (12-1pm ET): Sprint Demos (Weeks 2, 4, 6)**
- Share progress with cohort
- Get feedback

**Friday Week 7: Final Public Demo**

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

- **Workflow-driven:** Executable YAML workflows guide every step
- **Evaluation-first:** Build evaluation sets before implementations
- **Experiment-based:** Each workflow ends with a small experiment
- **Reflection-driven:** Each workflow begins with reflecting on previous experiments
- **Iterative:** YAML → Implementation → Refinement

---

## THREE-SPRINT JOURNEY

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Design and Prototype**
- Goal: Identify problem, design workflow solution, create eval set, build prototype
- Demo: Show problem, YAML design, working prototype, evaluation results

**Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Refine Implementation**
- Goal: Test with users, add component evaluation, refine architecture, add observability
- Demo: Show user feedback, component evaluation, architecture improvements

**Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6): Deploy to Production**
- Goal: Scale evaluation, deploy system, optimize costs, get real user feedback
- Demo: Show deployed system, cost analysis, scaled evaluation results

**Week 7: Demo Preparation**
- Goal: Synthesize journey into compelling 8-minute presentation
- Demo: Final public demo (recorded, published)

---

## DELIVERABLES

**By end of bootcamp:**
- Functional multi-agent application (deployed!)
- Complete evaluation framework
- Public demo video (portfolio piece)
- Real user feedback
- Cost analysis and optimization
- Complete project documentation

---

## TIME COMMITMENT

**Typical:** 10-15 hours/week
**Minimum viable:** 6-8 hours/week
**Distribution:**
- Monday/Wednesday sessions: 2 hours
- Independent work: 6-10 hours
- 1-on-1 mentorship: 1-2 hours
- Sprint demo prep: Variable

Most successful participants who completed public demo: 40-80 hours total over 7 weeks
