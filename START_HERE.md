## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

**Recommended:** Use Claude Code or a similar CLI tool that supports workflow execution.

If you don't have Claude Code installed yet, visit: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/setup

You do need a paid Claude account and the $20 per month tier should be sufficient.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Workspace

If you're reading this file, you've likely already completed this step, but here's what you need:

1. **Unzip the bootcamp folder** you received
2. **Save it somewhere stable** on your computer (e.g., `~/Documents/bootcamp2510/` or `C:\Users\YourName\bootcamp2510\`)
3. **Remember this location** - you'll return here throughout the bootcamp
4. Some workflows assume that the folder name is `bootcamp2510`. While you can rename the path in those or let Claude Code find the right location, it would be helpful to use this name to avoid unnecessary token usage.

### Step 2: Navigate to the Folder

Open your terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows) and navigate to the bootcamp folder:

```bash
cd /path/to/bootcamp2510
```

For example:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/bootcamp2510
```

### Step 3: Launch Claude Code

From the bootcamp folder, launch Claude Code:

```bash
claude
```

This will open Claude Code in your terminal, already in the correct directory.

### Step 4: Run the Master Orchestrator

In Claude Code, simply type in natural language:

```
Run the master orchestrator workflow
```

Or more specifically:

```
Execute the master orchestrator workflow
```

**What happens on first run:**

1. Creates your personal workspace folder structure (`your_workspace/`)
2. Has a brief conversation to understand your background and goals
3. Helps you define your project idea
4. Shows you where you are in the bootcamp timeline
5. Offers a menu of what to do next

**Time commitment:** ~30-45 minutes for initial setup

**Important:** Just follow the prompts and instructions. The workflow will guide you through everything conversationally.

### Step 5: Use It Regularly

Return to the master orchestrator throughout the bootcamp:

**Recommended frequency:**

- **Ideal:** 2-3 times per week

  - Monday before/after Interactive Lab
  - Mid-week check-in (Wednesday/Thursday)
  - Weekend before working on your project

- **Minimum:** Once per week (Mondays)

**Critical times:**

- Start of each sprint
- Few days before each sprint demo
- When you're feeling lost or stuck

**Return visits:** Typically 60-90 minutes (includes progress check + working through building workflows)

## What Makes This Different

This isn't just documentation‚Äîit's an **adaptive, conversational coaching system** that:

‚úÖ **Adapts to your situation** - Whether you're ahead, on track, behind, or stuck
‚úÖ **Provides contextual guidance** - Knows what week you're in and what's next
‚úÖ **Tracks your journey** - Logs your activity to give better guidance over time
‚úÖ **Available 24/7** - Your coach between group sessions and 1-on-1 mentorship
‚úÖ **Actually helpful** - Not form-filling or rigid scripts, but real conversations

## What You'll Get

**Immediate value:**

- Clear visibility of where you are in the bootcamp
- Quick access to program info, deliverables, and help resources
- Personalized next-step recommendations

**Over time:**

- A complete log of your bootcamp journey
- Context-aware guidance that gets better with each use
- Gentle nudges to catch up when falling behind
- Celebration of progress and milestones

## Success Metrics

**You'll know this is working if:**

- ‚úì You feel clear about what to do each week
- ‚úì You're not hunting through Slack/Docs for basic info
- ‚úì You catch up when you fall behind
- ‚úì You actually run it 2-3x per week
- ‚úì You submit all sprint demos and the final demo

**This system succeeds when:** You complete the bootcamp and have a deployed project to show!

## Tips for Best Results

**Use it proactively:**

- Don't wait until you're completely lost
- Check in regularly to stay on track
- Use it before booking mentors (it might answer your question)

**Be honest in conversations:**

- If you're behind, say so‚Äîit helps with catch-up planning
- If you're confused, ask‚Äîthat's what it's for
- If you're ahead, share what's working for you

**Treat it like a coach, not a tool:**

- It learns about you over time
- The more you use it, the better it gets at helping
- It's OK to just chat about what you're working on

**Combine with human support:**

- This complements (doesn't replace) mentors and group sessions
- Use it between sessions to stay oriented
- Contact Amir directly if stuck for more than 1-2 days

## Philosophy

**Autonomy over automation:** This system has judgment and adapts to you‚Äîit's not a rigid script.

**Human-in-the-loop:** You stay in control; workflows guide and suggest, never force.

**Small experiments mindset:** Check in regularly, make small adjustments, build momentum.

**Delight in the experience:** This should feel helpful and encouraging, not like homework.

## Need Help?

1. Check that you're running it from a stable directory
2. Make sure activity logs are being created and updated
3. Contact Amir on Slack (#agents-bootcamp-2510) or email (bootcamp@ai.science)

**If you have ideas for improvement:**

- Share in Slack‚Äîworkflows will evolve based on cohort feedback
- Your usage patterns help us build better workflows for everyone
