## Goal: Show participant where they are in the bootcamp with clear visual progress indicators

Your task is to welcome them back, sync their task list, calculate where they are in the bootcamp timeline, show upcoming tasks, and provide data-driven status assessment.

---

## Phase 1: Welcome Back

1. **Get recent activity summary**
   - Execute: `./bootcamp_workflows/util/get_recent_activity.sh`
   - This returns: last check-in time and days since

2. **Brief welcome**
   - Display: "Welcome back! It's been [X days] since we last talked."
   - If less than 1 day: Just say "Welcome back!"
   - Keep it warm but brief‚Äîmove quickly to progress

---

## Phase 2: Sync Task List

1. **Run task sync script**
   - Execute: `./bootcamp_workflows/util/sync_tasks.sh`
   - This ensures their task list includes any new required tasks
   - Silent operation - just run it, don't show output unless there's an error

---

## Phase 3: Calculate Current Status

1. **Get participant and bootcamp context**
   - Execute: `./bootcamp_workflows/util/get_participant_info.sh`
   - This returns: current week, sprint, and sprint goal
   - Calculate: Days until next major milestone (use sprint demo dates)

2. **Get task completion data**
   - Execute: `./bootcamp_workflows/util/get_task_stats.sh`
   - This returns: done/in_progress/backlog counts and completion %

3. **Check for overdue or urgent tasks**
   - Execute: `./bootcamp_workflows/util/check_upcoming_tasks.sh`
   - Capture output to show upcoming tasks

## Phase 4: Create Visual Progress Indicator

**Overall Bootcamp Timeline:**
```
BOOTCAMP PROGRESS (7 weeks: Oct 20 - Dec 5, 2025)

Week:  1    2    3    4    5    6    7
       |----|----|----|----|----|----|
       ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë    Week 3 of 7

Sprint 1 ‚úÖ  Sprint 2 ‚Üí  Sprint 3 ‚¨ú  Final ‚¨ú

‚úÖ Sprint 1 Demo (submitted Oct 27)
üîµ Sprint 2 Demo (due Nov 10) ‚Üê 7 days away
‚¨ú Sprint 3 Demo (due Nov 24)
‚¨ú Final Demo (due Dec 5)
```

**Task Completion Progress:**
```
[Output from get_task_stats.sh with visual progress bar]
Example: TASKS: 12 done / 1 in_progress / 4 backlog (Total: 17)
Progress: ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 71% complete
```

**Upcoming Tasks (next 3 days):**
```
[Output from check_upcoming_tasks.sh]
```

**Recent Activity:**
```
[Output from get_recent_activity.sh]
```

## Phase 5: Data-Driven Status Assessment

Based on task data and deadlines, provide a brief status assessment:

**If they have overdue tasks:**
- "You have [X] overdue task(s). Let's prioritize catching up."

**If they're on track (no overdue, keeping up with upcoming deadlines):**
- "You're on schedule! [X] tasks completed, staying on top of deadlines."

**If they're ahead (high completion rate for current week):**
- "You're ahead of schedule! Great momentum‚Äî[XX]% of tasks complete."

**If they have tasks due soon but not started:**
- "You have [X] tasks due within 3 days that need attention."

**If no upcoming tasks:**
- "No immediate deadlines. Great time to work ahead or book a mentor session."

---

## Phase 6: Log Progress Check

Add entry to `bootcamp2510/your_workspace/logs/activity_log.csv`:

```csv
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS,master_orchestration,progress_check,Week [X] - [X]/[Total] tasks complete
```

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- **Run all utility scripts** in this order:
  1. `sync_tasks.sh` (silent - just sync)
  2. `get_recent_activity.sh` (for welcome)
  3. `get_participant_info.sh` (for context)
  4. `get_task_stats.sh` (for task completion)
  5. `check_upcoming_tasks.sh` (for upcoming tasks)
- **Be data-driven** - use actual script outputs, not vague intuition
- **Don't read CSV/MD files directly** - use the utility scripts instead
- **Be visual** - the ASCII progress bars and task output help participants see at a glance where they are
- **Be honest but supportive** - if they're behind, acknowledge it with specific numbers
- **Keep it concise** - they should be able to scan this in 30-60 seconds
- **Use brand colors in mindset:**
  - ‚úÖ Green/checkmark for completed
  - üîµ Blue for current/active (primary blue: #2C66BD conceptually)
  - ‚¨ú Gray for upcoming
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning for overdue
  - Use filled blocks (‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà) for completed portions, hollow (‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë) for remaining
- After showing progress, automatically proceed to menu_and_routing
- Remember to log the progress check and update Conversation Notes

## Output Requirements

- ASCII visualization of bootcamp timeline
- Task completion statistics with progress bar (from get_task_stats.sh)
- Upcoming tasks (from check_upcoming_tasks.sh)
- Recent activity summary (from get_recent_activity.sh)
- Data-driven status message based on task completion
- Log entry for progress_check with task completion data

After completing this step, proceed automatically to menu_and_routing.
