## Goal: Check if participant has completed orientation

Your task is to determine if this is a first-time participant or a returning participant.

---

## Phase 1: Check for Lock File

Check if `bootcamp2510/your_workspace/.workflow_initialized` exists.

**If it EXISTS:**
- This is a returning participant
- Proceed to progress_assessment (step4)

**If it DOES NOT EXIST:**
- This is a first-time participant who needs orientation
- Proceed to orientation_redirect (step2)

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- Use a simple file existence check: `test -f bootcamp2510/your_workspace/.workflow_initialized`
- Do NOT display any messages to the user yet
- Just determine the path and route accordingly
- This is a silent routing step

---

## Output Requirements

- Determine existence of lock file
- Route to appropriate next step (orientation_redirect or returning_participant)

This step should be nearly instantaneous and invisible to the user.
