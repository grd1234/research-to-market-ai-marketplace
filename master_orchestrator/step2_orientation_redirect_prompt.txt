## Message to Display

```
Welcome to the Build Multi-Agent Applications Bootcamp! ðŸŽ‰

I can see this is your first time here. Let me get you set upâ€”this will take about 5-10 minutes.

We'll:
- Set up your bootcamp workspace
- Get to know you and your goals
- Initialize your activity tracking

Let's get started...
```

## Launch Orientation Workflow

After displaying the welcome message, automatically launch the orientation workflow:

**Execute:** `logistics/orientation/orientation_workflow.md` (relative to master_orchestration folder)

The orientation workflow will handle:
1. Workspace setup
2. Profile conversation
3. Goal setting
4. Finalization (creating lock file)

After orientation completes and returns control to master orchestration, the workflow will automatically continue to progress_assessment (the lock file now exists).

---

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- Display brief welcome message
- Immediately launch the orientation workflow using relative path: `logistics/orientation/orientation_workflow.md`
- The orientation workflow takes over from here
- After orientation completes, master orchestration automatically continues to progress_assessment (the lock file now exists)

---

## Output Requirements

- Welcome message displayed
- Orientation workflow launched automatically via relative path

User experience: seamless flow from master orchestration â†’ orientation â†’ progress_assessment â†’ menu_and_routing, all in one session.
