# Bootcamp Participant Profile

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-20

## About

Geeta brings a unique blend of product management and coding/development experience to the bootcamp. She has hands-on experience building AI-powered applications, particularly in RAG systems and semantic search. She's taking this bootcamp to level up from basic agent development to sophisticated multi-agent orchestration, with the ambitious goal of building a full research-to-commercialization marketplace platform.

## Background & Context

Geeta has a background in both product management and development, giving her a strong perspective on building products that solve real problems. She's built production AI applications including semantic search for food delivery and hotel platforms (Sabre API integration), eCommerce sentiment analysis, and various ML applications. She's worked with LangChain to build agents that integrate multiple tools, giving her a solid foundation in agent basics. Now she's ready to tackle more sophisticated multi-agent systems with proper reasoning, memory, and tool integration through components like MCP.

## Bootcamp Journey

**Cohort:** October 2025 (Oct 20 - Dec 5, 2025)
**Cohort Start Date:** 2025-10-20
**Cohort End Date:** 2025-12-05

**What They're Working On:**
An AI-powered marketplace that accelerates the transformation of academic and tech research into market-ready innovations. The platform connects researchers, investors, and industry partners (R&D teams, innovation hubs, enterprise product leaders) using semantic intelligence, explainable trust, and rigorous evaluation to ensure transparency, reliability, and high-impact collaboration.

**What They're Hoping to Achieve:**
Build a working research-to-commercialization platform by the end of the bootcamp. The goal is ambitious but grounded in practical iteration—starting with evaluation frameworks, building core agent interactions, and validating the architecture. She's exploring whether tools like n8n can handle the orchestration versus custom code, planning to run that experiment early in the process.

**Technical Approach:**
Comfortable with both product thinking and hands-on development. Exploring low-code/no-code tools like n8n and Vibe coding to simplify the development process while maintaining the sophistication needed for multi-agent architecture.

## Personal Goals

**Weekly Time Commitment:** 4 days/week

**Sprint Goals:**

**Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2):**
Ideation and evaluation. For the marketplace platform:
- Define the core problem and key user workflows:
  - Industry partner searches for relevant innovations on research platforms like arXiv, GoogleScholar etc., Creates a use case based on a topic or a selected research paper, and expresses interest in productizing by submitting proper documentation in the marketplace
  - Marketplace System facilitates connection with prospective investors
  - Final step involves formalizing the collaboration or investment agreement through a secure checkout or partnership confirmation process
- Build evaluation dataset with example scenarios
- Create YAML workflow mapping out key agent interactions

**Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4):**
Start implementing the agent system—translate YAML workflows into working agents, test with real scenarios, and gather feedback from potential users.

**Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-6):**
Refine and scale—add more sophisticated matching logic, improve semantic search, add observability to see what's working.

**Final Demo (Week 7):**
Working prototype that handles at least one end-to-end flow—researcher submission to investor/partner connection with partnership confirmation.

**Weekly Check-in Rhythm:**
Friday check-ins to review progress and plan next steps.

**Personal Success Criteria:**
Build a functional multi-agent platform that demonstrates the full research-to-commercialization workflow, validating whether n8n can handle sophisticated agent orchestration while learning best practices for multi-agent system architecture.

## Project Idea

**Status:** Defined

**Project Title:** Research-to-Market AI Marketplace

**Description:**
An AI-powered marketplace that accelerates the transformation of academic and tech research into market-ready innovations by connecting researchers, investors, and industry partners. The platform enables researchers to post innovations or retrieve existing research from platforms like arXiv, allows industry partners to search for relevant innovations and create use cases, facilitates connections with prospective investors, and formalizes collaboration through secure partnership confirmation processes. Built on semantic intelligence, explainable trust, and rigorous evaluation to ensure transparency and reliability.

**Why This Project:**
Bridging the gap between research and commercialization is a critical challenge—brilliant research often stays in academia because there's no clear path to market. This platform creates that bridge by intelligently connecting the right stakeholders (researchers, industry partners, investors) at the right time, using multi-agent systems to handle matching, evaluation, and facilitation. It's ambitious but addresses a real market need, and the multi-agent architecture is perfect for learning sophisticated orchestration patterns.
