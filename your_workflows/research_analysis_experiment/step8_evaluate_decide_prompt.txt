## Goal: Measure metrics, make Go/No-Go decision, plan next steps

Your task is to guide the user through evaluating the complete experiment, making a decisive Go/No-Go decision based on evidence, and planning concrete next steps.

### Why This Matters
This is where the rubber meets the road. All the testing data needs to translate into a clear decision: proceed to Phase 1 MVP, pivot to a different approach, or stop. Indecision is the enemy of progress.

## Phase 1: Compile Final Metrics

### 1. Aggregate all experiment data
Gather data from all previous steps into one place:

**Create:** `your_workspace/your_workflows/research_analysis_experiment/final_experiment_report.md`

## Identified Limitations

### Critical Limitations (Blockers)
{{ List any showstoppers that must be resolved }}

### Moderate Limitations (Workarounds Possible)
{{ List issues that can be mitigated }}

### Minor Limitations (Acceptable Trade-offs)
{{ List minor issues that won't block progress }}

---

## Strengths Identified

{{ What worked exceptionally well? }}

---

## Final Decision: {{ GO / PROCEED WITH CAUTION / PIVOT / STOP }}

**Reasoning:**
{{ 3-5 sentences explaining the decision based on evidence }}

---

## Next Steps

{{ See Phase 2 below for details }}

---

*Report Generated: {{ timestamp }}*
*Total Experiment Duration: {{ days }}*
```

**Why this matters:** A comprehensive report provides evidence-based justification for whatever decision you make.

---

## Phase 2: Make the Go/No-Go Decision

### 2. Decide the path forward
Based on the Decision Matrix score:

**If GO (4 YES):**
Proceed directly to Phase 3 (Plan Phase 1 MVP Implementation)

**If PROCEED WITH CAUTION (3 YES):**
1. Identify the concern (which question was NO?)
2. Can it be resolved before starting Phase 1?
3. What specific mitigation plans are needed?
4. Decision: Resolve concerns first, OR accept risk and proceed

**If PIVOT (2 YES):**
1. What were the 2 blockers?
2. What alternative approaches could address them?
   - Different tool (LangGraph, custom code)?
   - Different scope (simpler workflow)?
   - Different architecture (remove blocking checkpoints)?
3. Is a second experiment needed?

**If STOP (0-1 YES):**
1. Why did the experiment fail?
2. Was it the wrong problem, wrong approach, or wrong tools?
3. What did you learn?
4. Should you revisit the problem definition (back to Step 1)?

**Document the decision clearly** in the final report.

**Why this matters:** A clear decision prevents analysis paralysis and enables action.

## Phase 3: Plan Phase 1 MVP Implementation (If GO)

### 3. Create Phase 1 MVP implementation plan
If the decision is GO or PROCEED WITH CAUTION:

**File:** `your_workspace/your_workflows/research_analysis_experiment/phase1_mvp_plan.md`

```markdown
# Phase 1 MVP Implementation Plan

**Decision:** {{ GO / PROCEED WITH CAUTION }}
**Start Date:** {{ date }}
**Target Completion:** {{ 2 weeks from start }}

## Decision Point After Phase 1

After Week 2, evaluate:
- Did Phase 1 MVP meet success criteria?
- Ready to proceed to Phase 2 (multi-agent)?
- OR need iteration / pivot?

Next review: {{ date 2 weeks out }}
```

**Why this matters:** A concrete plan transforms the GO decision into actionable next steps.

**Reason:** {{ why experiment didn't meet criteria }}

---

## Experiment Findings

**What worked:**
- {{ positive finding }}

**What didn't work:**
- {{ blocker 1 }} - {{ explanation }}
- {{ blocker 2 }} - {{ explanation }}

**Root Cause:**
{{ Was it n8n limitations? LLM capabilities? Workflow design? }}

## Instructions for the AI Assistant

- Be objective - don't sugarcoat failures or downplay successes
- Help the user make a data-driven decision, not an emotional one
- If the decision is GO, be enthusiastic and supportive about Phase 1
- If the decision is PIVOT, help them see it as valuable learning, not failure
- If the decision is STOP, help them extract maximum learning value
- Encourage documenting everything - these notes are gold for future work
- Congratulate the user for completing a rigorous experiment!
- Remind them that small experiments are how great systems are built
- This is the end of the ideation workflow - celebrate the journey from problem to validated approach!
