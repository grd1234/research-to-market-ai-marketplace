# Checkpoint Design Review Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** ✅ REVIEW COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

---

## Executive Summary

All 3 checkpoints have been reviewed and are **ready for implementation** with one critical merge completed.

**Overall Readiness: 95% ✅**

---

## Checkpoint 1: Paper Retrieval + Interest Level Selection

**File:** `step3_build_paper_retrieval_prompt.txt`

### Status: ✅ READY

**Strengths:**
- Clear 4-level interest selection (Monitoring/Exploring/Pilot-Ready/Seeking Funding)
- Explains validation requirements upfront (3/8/12/14 items)
- Clean paper review interface
- State management saves interest_level for next checkpoint

**Minor Enhancement Suggestion:**
- Add brief preview of validation items for each level (not blocking)

**Action Required:** NONE - Proceed as designed ✅

---

## Checkpoint 2: Analysis Review + Validation Checklist

**Files:**
- `step5_build_analysis_pipeline_prompt.txt` (updated)
- `checkpoint2_merged_design.md` (NEW - canonical version)
- `checkpoint2_validation_checklist_enhancement.md` (reference)

### Status: ✅ READY (MERGE COMPLETED)

**Issue Identified:**
Two different Checkpoint 2 designs existed (simple form vs. enhanced checklist)

**Resolution:** ✅ COMPLETED
- Created merged design: `checkpoint2_merged_design.md`
- Updated Step 5 prompt to reference merged design
- Merged design includes all enhancements:
  - ✅ Tiered validation checklist (3/8/12/14 items)
  - ✅ Progress bar (real-time X/Y complete)
  - ✅ Draft saving capability
  - ✅ Validation logic (blocks incomplete submissions)
  - ✅ Help text for all fields
  - ✅ AI pre-filling indicators

**Action Required:** Use `checkpoint2_merged_design.md` as canonical reference during Step 5 implementation ✅

---

## Checkpoint 3: Final Approval + Marketplace Preview

**Files:**
- `step6_build_output_final_checkpoint_prompt.txt`
- `checkpoint3_marketplace_preview_enhancement.md`

### Status: ✅ READY

**Strengths:**
- Shows complete use case document
- Marketplace listing preview based on interest level
- Clear visibility explanation (who sees what)
- Option to change interest level before listing
- Three-checkbox approval gate

**Minor Enhancement Suggestion:**
- Add visual marketplace preview card (not just text description) - not blocking

**Action Required:** NONE - Proceed as designed ✅

---

## Files Created/Updated

### New Files:
1. ✅ `checkpoint2_merged_design.md` - **CANONICAL Checkpoint 2 implementation guide**
2. ✅ `CHECKPOINT_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` - This document

### Updated Files:
1. ✅ `step5_build_analysis_pipeline_prompt.txt` - Now references merged design

### Reference Files (unchanged):
- `step3_build_paper_retrieval_prompt.txt` - Checkpoint 1 design
- `step6_build_output_final_checkpoint_prompt.txt` - Checkpoint 3 design
- `checkpoint2_validation_checklist_enhancement.md` - Original enhancement (kept for reference)
- `checkpoint3_marketplace_preview_enhancement.md` - Checkpoint 3 enhancement

## Implementation Checklist

When building in n8n (Steps 3, 5, 6):

### Checkpoint 1 (Step 3):
- [ ] Display papers with title, authors, abstract, PDF link
- [ ] Show 4 interest level options with descriptions
- [ ] Explain validation requirements (3/8/12/14 items)
- [ ] Save `interest_level` to workflow state
- [ ] Implement approve/refine decision flow

### Checkpoint 2 (Step 5):
- [ ] **Use `checkpoint2_merged_design.md` as reference**
- [ ] Display AI-generated analyses (technical + commercial)
- [ ] Generate validation checklist based on interest_level
- [ ] Implement progress bar (X/Y items complete)
- [ ] Add draft saving capability
- [ ] Validate all required fields before allowing "Complete"
- [ ] Save `validation_data` and `checklist_complete` to state

### Checkpoint 3 (Step 6):
- [ ] Display complete use case document
- [ ] Show marketplace preview based on interest_level
- [ ] Validate checklist_complete status
- [ ] Allow interest level change with warnings
- [ ] Three-checkbox approval (document + checklist + marketplace)
- [ ] Final approval gate before listing

---

## Key Design Decisions

### Tiered Validation System
**Decision:** Use 4 interest levels with progressive validation requirements
- Monitoring: 3 items (passive tracking)
- Exploring: 8 items (active evaluation)
- Pilot-Ready: 12 items (ready to test)
- Seeking Funding: 14 items (investor-ready) ← **ONLY level visible to investors**

**Rationale:** Matches partner commitment level, reduces barrier to entry, maintains quality gate for investors

### Draft Saving
**Decision:** Allow users to save incomplete checklists and return later
**Rationale:** Reduces pressure, increases completion rate, enables iterative validation

### AI Pre-filling
**Decision:** AI auto-completes what it can (technical approach), partner fills gaps
**Rationale:** Reduces manual work, focuses human effort on business judgment items

### Progress Tracking
**Decision:** Real-time progress bar showing X/Y items complete
**Rationale:** Clear feedback, reduces anxiety, shows path to completion

## Testing Requirements

Before moving to production, test each checkpoint:

### Checkpoint 1 Testing:
- [ ] All 4 interest levels selectable
- [ ] Papers display correctly
- [ ] Approve decision proceeds to analysis
- [ ] Refine decision loops back with new query
- [ ] State persists (interest_level accessible in next step)

### Checkpoint 2 Testing:
- [ ] Monitoring level shows 3 items
- [ ] Exploring level shows 8 items
- [ ] Pilot-Ready level shows 12 items
- [ ] Seeking Funding level shows 14 items
- [ ] Progress bar updates in real-time
- [ ] Cannot submit "Complete" with incomplete checklist
- [ ] "Save Draft" works at any completion level
- [ ] All form data captured by webhook

### Checkpoint 3 Testing:
- [ ] Document displays correctly
- [ ] Marketplace preview matches interest level
- [ ] Validation status checks work
- [ ] Interest level change warnings appear
- [ ] Cannot approve without all checkboxes
- [ ] Final approval completes workflow

## Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Review complete - checkpoints ready
2. Continue with experiment workflow Step 1 (Environment & API setup)

**During Implementation:**
3. At Step 3: Build Checkpoint 1 per `step3_build_paper_retrieval_prompt.txt`
4. At Step 5: Build Checkpoint 2 per `checkpoint2_merged_design.md` ← **USE THIS**
5. At Step 6: Build Checkpoint 3 per `step6_build_output_final_checkpoint_prompt.txt`

**After Implementation:**
6. Test all 3 checkpoints with real workflow
7. Document any issues encountered
8. Run full end-to-end test (Step 7)

## Questions for User

Before proceeding, confirm:
1. ✅ Are you satisfied with the merged Checkpoint 2 design?
2. ✅ Do you want to implement the minor enhancements (visual marketplace preview) or defer to Phase 2?
3. ✅ Ready to proceed with Step 1 (Environment & API setup)?

---

**Status:** All checkpoints reviewed and ready for implementation ✅

**Recommendation:** Proceed with experiment workflow starting from Step 1.
