## Connection to Phase 3

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Integration:**

Once Phase 2 is operational, Phase 3 enables researchers to:

- Get matched to industry partners and investors based on research focus
- Track commercialization progress for their innovations

Phase 2 creates the demand signal (investor interest), which Phase 3 uses to attract researcher participation.
