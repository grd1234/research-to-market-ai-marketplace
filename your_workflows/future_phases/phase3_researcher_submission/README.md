# Phase 3: Researcher Submission & Matching Workflow

## Overview

Phase 3 completes the Research-to-Market AI Marketplace by enabling researchers to proactively submit innovations, get matched with industry partners and investors, and track commercialization progress.

**Vision:** Researchers can submit their innovations, receive AI-powered commercial viability assessments, get matched with partners/investors actively seeking their research, and track their innovations through the commercialization journey.

---

## Problem Phase 3 Solves

**For Researchers:**
- 70% of high-impact research never reaches commercialization - unclear pathways
- Limited visibility into which companies/investors need their research
- Technology transfer offices provide minimal support
- No systematic way to track commercialization opportunities
- Miss opportunities because they don't know who's searching for their work

**Phase 3 Solution:**
- Direct submission to marketplace with visibility to partners/investors
- AI analysis of commercial potential and market fit
- Proactive matching to partners already searching for similar research (from Phase 1)
- Visibility into investor interest (from Phase 2)
- Track commercialization progress and impact

---

## Prerequisites

**Before Starting Phase 3:**
- ✅ Phase 1 operational (industry partners searching and validating research)
- ✅ Phase 2 operational (investors discovering opportunities)
- ✅ Proof of successful connections in Phase 1 + 2
- ✅ Trust established with research community (early success stories)
- ✅ Integration with research platforms (ORCID, Google Scholar)
